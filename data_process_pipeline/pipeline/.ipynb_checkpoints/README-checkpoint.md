# Data Processing Pipeline Overview

## Component 0: Culture Relevance Classifier
- **Purpose**: Filters out non-culture related content
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses a binary classification model
  - Determines if text is related to workplace culture
- **Technical Details**:
  - Model: DistilBERT-based classifier
  - Fine-tuned on culture-related content
  - Outputs binary classification (culture-relevant or not)

## Component 1: Knowledge Extractor
- **Purpose**: Extracts meaningful cultural insights from text
- **Key Features**:
  - Identifies cultural statements and beliefs
  - Extracts actionable insights
- **Technical Details**:
  - Uses GPT-based extraction
  - Pattern matching for cultural statement identification
  - Structured output format for downstream processing

## Component 3: Clustering
- **Purpose**: Groups similar cultural statements together
- **Key Features**:
  - Creates semantic clusters of related insights
  - Reduces redundancy in statements
- **Technical Details**:
  - Uses sentence transformers for embeddings
  - HDBSCAN clustering algorithm
  - Cosine similarity for distance metrics

## Component 4: Cluster Summarizer
- **Purpose**: Creates representative summaries for each cluster
- **Key Features**:
  - Generates concise cluster descriptions
  - Maintains key themes and sentiments
- **Technical Details**:
  - Uses Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct model
  - Supports adapter-based fine-tuning
  - 4-bit quantization for efficiency
  - Flash attention 2 for improved performance
  - Temperature-controlled generation (0.3)
  - Top-k (10) and top-p (1.0) sampling

## Component 5: Topic Normalization
- **Purpose**: Standardizes topics and themes across clusters
- **Key Features**:
  - Normalizes vocabulary and terminology
  - Maps similar concepts to standard forms
- **Technical Details**:
  - Uses topic modeling (LDA)
  - Semantic similarity matching
  - Custom vocabulary mapping

## Component 6: Agreement Calculator
- **Purpose**: Measures consensus within clusters
- **Key Features**:
  - Calculates agreement scores
  - Identifies areas of alignment/misalignment
- **Technical Details**:
  - Statistical analysis of statement frequencies
  - Weighted scoring based on cluster size
  - Confidence interval calculations

## Component 7: Content Moderation
- **Purpose**: Ensures appropriate and safe content
- **Key Features**:
  - Filters inappropriate content
  - Checks for bias and sensitivity
- **Technical Details**:
  - Multi-label classification
  - Toxicity detection models
  - Custom rules-based filtering

## Component 8: Final Formatter
- **Purpose**: Prepares data for final output
- **Key Features**:
  - Standardizes output format
  - Creates final report structure
- **Technical Details**:
  - JSON/CSV formatting
  - Data validation checks
  - Report template generation
