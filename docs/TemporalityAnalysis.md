# Temporal Analysis for CultureBank

This document outlines strategies for incorporating temporal awareness into the CultureBank pipeline, enabling tracking of cultural evolution and drift over time.

## Core Temporal Features

### Time-Aware Data Processing
- Preserve temporal fields across pipeline:
  - `comment_utc`
  - `raw_sample_times`
  - `time_range`
- Support event-based anchoring (e.g., pre-/post-pandemic)
- Implement time-based support bins:
  - [2015–2017]
  - [2018–2020]
  - [2021–2023]

### Cultural Drift Detection
- Segment clusters by time slice while maintaining cluster_id
- Compare temporal summaries to detect shifts in:
  - Behavior language
  - Group participation
  - Normativity
- Enable "before vs. after" comparative analysis
- Flag areas requiring model retraining

## Advanced Temporal Analysis

### Time-Aware Agreement Scoring
- Compute temporal agreement curves
- Track norm evolution:
  - Historical acceptance vs. current contestation
  - Store agreement trajectories per cluster
- Differentiate between:
  - Long-standing norms
  - Temporary trends
  - Contested cultural shifts

### Temporal Model Training

#### Fine-Tuning Strategies
- Implement temporal weighting:
  - Down-weight outdated clusters
  - Up-weight recent high-agreement clusters
- Create time-sliced models:
  - CultureBank-2020
  - CultureBank-2023
- Enable model ensembling and comparison

#### Prompt-Time Conditioning
- Add temporal context to prompts:
  - Format: "As of 2022, what do people from Group X tend to do when..."
- Fine-tune for year/event-specific generation
- Enable temporally contextualized cultural awareness

## Monitoring and Visualization

### Culture Timeline Tools
- Dashboard features:
  - Cultural practice evolution charts
  - Trend spike/wane visualization
  - Variant splitting analysis
- Research and design team accessibility

### Model Maintenance

#### Periodic Updates
- Schedule regular pipeline runs (e.g., quarterly)
- Process newly scraped platform data
- Track cluster changes:
  - New cluster emergence
  - Existing cluster evolution

#### Update Mechanisms
- Implement continual learning
- Use LoRA updates
- Apply delta training on base model

### Cultural Volatility Index
- Track per-cluster metrics:
  - Temporal change frequency
  - Agreement score variance
  - Normativity language shifts
- Prioritize monitoring of dynamic behaviors
- Flag clusters for re-annotation

## Implementation Benefits
1. Enhanced temporal awareness in cultural modeling
2. More accurate representation of cultural evolution
3. Better handling of emerging trends
4. Improved model maintenance and updates
5. Greater transparency in cultural shift detection
