# CultureBank Next Steps

This document outlines proposed improvements and enhancements for the CultureBank pipeline. Each section represents a key area for development and refinement.

## 1. Human-in-the-Loop Enhancements
- Implement review interface for:
  - Cluster summaries
  - Normalization outputs
  - Agreement scores
- Develop structured feedback system for annotators
- Enable continuous pipeline improvement through user feedback

## 2. Confidence Scoring and Uncertainty Tracking
- Implement model confidence tracking per field during knowledge extraction
- Add generation uncertainty monitoring during summarization
- Develop agreement entropy quantification in Step 6
  - Focus on distinguishing strong vs. weak consensus

## 3. Fine-Grained Agreement Typing
- Separate normativity from frequency:
  - Distinguish "common behavior" from "expected norm"
- Add new fields for:
  - Behavior consensus
  - Cultural accuracy
  - Perception bias

## 4. Enhanced Pre-Moderation in Step 0
- Implement content quality filters
- Add toxicity detection
- Develop early detection for:
  - Bot-like content
  - Spam
  - Harmful content

## 5. Cross-Cultural Linking and Contrastive Analysis
- Create semantic linking between clusters across cultural groups
- Implement contrastive example identification
- Focus on highlighting cultural differences

## 6. Embedding-Based Search and Exploration
- Develop semantic search interface using final summary embeddings
- Implement filtering capabilities for:
  - Cultural group
  - Topic
  - Agreement level
  - Time period

## 7. Evaluation Harness and Benchmarking
- Create comprehensive evaluation system for model generations
- Focus on testing:
  - Cultural accuracy
  - Relevance
  - Generalization capabilities
- Support fine-tuning validation

## 8. Ontology and Taxonomy Integration
- Implement formal ontology/taxonomy linking for:
  - Cultural groups
  - Topics
- Develop ontology-aware models for:
  - Clustering
  - Normalization
  - Search functionality

## 9. Metadata Enrichment
- Expand temporal analysis:
  - Trend detection
  - Seasonality analysis
- Add source tracking:
  - Platform identification
  - Community context
  - Cultural variation modeling

## 10. Pipeline Efficiency and Auditability
- Implement lineage tracking:
  - Hash-based IDs
  - Raw comment to final descriptor traceability
- Add comprehensive transformation logging:
  - Step-by-step tracking
  - Audit support
  - Rollback capabilities
